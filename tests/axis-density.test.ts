/**
 * Three axis defects reported off a live NIFTY chart, side by side with a
 * professional terminal:
 *
 *   1. the price ladder printed six labels whatever the pane measured, so a tall
 *      chart read one price every 120 px where the reference read one every 30
 *   2. a session that had just opened carried no date on the time axis, because
 *      labels were only ever placed on the regular grid and the new day had too
 *      few bars to reach the next grid tick
 *   3. bars painted past the plot's right edge, into the price-axis strip
 *
 * All three are about what the axis prints, not about the numbers behind it.
