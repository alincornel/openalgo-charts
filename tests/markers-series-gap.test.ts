/**
 * A marker on a bar its own series has no point for (src/primitives/markers.ts).
 *
 * The layer is bound to one series, which decides the pane and the price scale
 * it lives on. The height of a mark, though, comes from the bar underneath it,
 * and those are not always the same row of data.
 *
 * An indicator that draws one coloured line while a trend is up and another
 * while it is down has a gap in each of them by construction. Its flip marks
 * land exactly in those gaps: the bar where the up line first appears is the
 * bar where the down line stops. Before this fix the mark was dropped, with no
 * warning anywhere, and the symptom was maddening to read: the buy mark of such
 * a study appeared and the sell mark never did, because only one of the two
 * flips fell on a bar the first plot happened to cover.
